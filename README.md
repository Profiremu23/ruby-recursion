# ruby-recursion
My first recursive Ruby programs for my Odin Project (TOP) journey

The two programs created for this project, Fibonacci and Merge Sort are used to demonstrate the wonders of a newly learnt programming concept of recursion by me. By using recursion, repetitive looping can be simplified without the usage of iterative programming, cutting down dozens of lines of code to a few, increasing the readability of the software's source code.

If you are not familiar with the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence), it is a numerical sequence where each number is a sum of the previous two numbers before it (i.e. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...). With recursion, a Ruby fibonacci program with recursion will be much clearer and simpler than if it is done with iteration.

[Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is a type of data sorting based on the divide and conquer programming concept, where it recurses an unsorted array's data until there is a single item left in the smallest sub-set, then re-merging those items back into a new resorted array. By using recursion, our Ruby Merge Sort program will be easy to look at, and it would be difficult to replicate merge sorting with only iteration.

## How do you run it?
In order to run these wonderful masterpieces of software, navigate to ../ruby-recursion by using your Git/Linux/MacOS terminal, then enter "ruby lib/fibonacci.rb" or "ruby lib/merge_sort.rb" to run one of the two programs. Hope you enjoy it!
